    <p>Jenin dates back to ancient times, and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is
        located in the occupied West Bank in Palestine. The Jenin Governorate consists of the city of Jenin (center),
        Jenin camp, and a group of villages. The city is known for its resistance to the Israeli occupation, especially
        its camp, which has become a symbol of steadfastness and resistance. It is subjected to continuous military
        operations in an attempt to eliminate the resistance there.</p>
